# TODOIST Rules - DEPRECATED

This document is deprecated. I'm replacing it with a new system that based more
strongly on the GTD methodology. I'm keeping this document here for reference
until I have fully transitioned to the new system.

## The Inbox

- The inbox is the place where all tasks are collected.
- All tasks should be processed as frequently as possible.

### Processing the inbox

- if a task can be done in less than 2 minutes, do it now.
- if a task has already been done, or is no longer relevant, delete it.

- all tasks should be given an appropriate label.

### Funneling Tasks

Before the inbox can be processed, all tasks should be funneled into the inbox
from the following sources:

- IOS Reminders
- Email inboxes
- Downloads folder
- Physical inbox
- TODOIST inbox

## Labels

## Priority Level

Todoist offers four different priority levels, ranging from 1 to 4, with 1 being
the highest. Each task should be given a priority level, even if just the
default(P4). The priority of a task may change over time, so priority
evaluations should be part of the weekly review.

### P1

P1 tasks are urgent and important. Tasks that should be done right now, that
will have severe consequences if not. For example, “Finish proposal for meeting
with client tomorrow” These are not tasks that I find the context for, these are
tasks that I set the context for.

### P2

P2 tasks are important but not urgent, these also must be done, but not as
immediately as P1 tasks. These should better reflect long terms goals, like
“check innovate UK for new funding opportunities”

### P3

P3 tasks are fairly unguent, but not that important, If I am to do this task, it
should be done now, but it's not really worth changing my day plans for. For
example, Renewing library books would be urgent, but if I don’t do it, it won't
have severe consequences. P3 Tasks are the type of tasks that should be
delegated if possible.

### P4

P4 tasks that are not critical, and not urgent. Just tasks that need doing at
some point, For example, “Update software on phone” or “Read the book that
George recommended”.
