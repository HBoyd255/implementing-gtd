is platform agnostic, and can be implemented using any tool that allows for,
there are even multiple ways in which the system can be implemented using
Todoist. This document will describe the system I have created using Todoist.

Full credit to David Allen for the
[GTD methodology](https://gettingthingsdone.com/), and to the
[Todoist](https://todoist.com/) team for creating a platform that allows for
such a system to be implemented.

oversimplifying the GTD methodology. For a full understanding of the GTD system,
I recommend reading "Getting Things Done" by David Allen.
